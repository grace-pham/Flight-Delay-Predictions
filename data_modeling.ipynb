    "\n",
    "Millions of passengers fly everyday (except when a pandemic is taking place) and because flying is one of the fastest ways to travel, demand may get overwhelming, causing delays in departures and landings. Flight delays cause more than just inconvenience - it costs airlines and passegner money from rebooking flights, missing connecting flights, having to provide hotel and purchase food if the next flight is hours or days away. We hope to uncover certain trends from this data such as which airlines have the most delays, which destinations are most impacted, what are the causes of these delays, on average when are these delays happening the most, and build predictive classification models and compare which one can predict flight delays the best.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using this data found from the U.S. Department of Transportation's (DOT) Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) helps give insight into different factors at play when flights are delayed. This project utilized Apache Spark for downsizing the data and multiple Python libraries for pre-processing, EDA, visualizations, and predictive modeling. The results will benefit passengers to help plan their next itineraries and prepare the best plan of action to make sure their flights to their destination are as delay-free as possible."

Secondly, a positive MSE contradicts the R-squared score of 1.0 which should be equivalent to a MSE of 0. Apparently, the result is highly questionable and does not add up.
